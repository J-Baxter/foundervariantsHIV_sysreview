# Inferring the multiplicity of founder variant initiating HIV-1 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis

This repository contains the code and data associated with the above manuscript.
Pooling files and metaregression files are labelled as appropriate. 
Files titled 'Binary' are analyses that infer classification of 'single' or 'multiple' founder infections, whereas 'Poisson' labelled files consider the number of founder variants as a count variable.
'Poisson' files are mostly deprecated and represent incomplete analyses that remain unpublished.
