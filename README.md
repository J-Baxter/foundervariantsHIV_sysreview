# Inferring the multiplicity of founder variant initiating HIV-1 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis

This repository contains the code and data associated with the above manuscript.

## Data
All the required data to run the code is available in the data.zip file. It is not necessary to decompress this file manually as this is done automatically using the Retrieve function in generalpurpose_funcs.R

## Scripts
All scripts marked binary refer to the calculation of the proportion of infections initiated by multiple variants (ie single vs multiple founders), rather than the number of variants that initiated infection. 

Providing the required packages are available, each script will run and create an output to a 'results' directory.

binary_pooling.R, binary_univarmetareg.R and binary_metareg.R encode the analyses for pooling, univariable meta-analysis and multivariable meta-analysis respectively. Each script contains the respective sensitivity analyses. **Some of these sensitivity analyses require hours to run as we are resampling and recalculating the models a thousand times**

Postprocessing may be required in order to retrieve the plots generated by binary_poolng_vis.R
